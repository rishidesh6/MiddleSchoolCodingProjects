# U.S.A Weather Tracker
For my second school coding project in 8th grade, I decided to create a weather tracker using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
I was able to obtain data about the weather in different cities in the U.S.A using an API, and also transfer it into plaintext.
This project had a lot to do with functions, div's, and if statements (turning all the data into plaintext).
I learned a lot about designing a website with CSS, coding the inner workings of that website with HTML, and of course, coding the main program with Javascript.
