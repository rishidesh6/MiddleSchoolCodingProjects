# NBA Score Tracker
In 8th grade for a school project, I decided to blend my passion for Basketball and learn more about how APIs while coding in my favorite programming language, Python.
I created an app that would state all of the NBA basketball games that occurred on any day from 2008 onwards.
I used this API - https://api-basketball.p.rapidapi.com/games. This API provides variety of data such as NBA Stats DATA, Games, Livescore, Standings, Statistics, Teams, Players, Seasons and Leagues based on the parameters passed in the API.
