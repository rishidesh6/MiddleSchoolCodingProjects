# Amazon 2.0
I researched about the basics of HTML, and then turned that into a store(fake money).
This required knowledge about buttons in HTML, and programming them to take away from your total amount of money.
There is a cart where you can add items you want to buy, and then you can purchase the cart, which takes away money from your total.
Additionally, I had to learn about styling the website so that everything was in rows and was organized neatly.
