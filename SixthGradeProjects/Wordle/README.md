# Wordle 2.0
As a way to further my knoweledge of coding with Python, I decided to code Wordle in Python.
The Wordle I made didn't have a grid or colors, but instead used letters like g, r, and b to say where the letters were in the word.
I needed to use list and map datastructures to get the words that were the answers and then the results of where the letters were in the correct word.
